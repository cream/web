<h1>What is Cream?</h1>

Cream is a project working on a new GTK+-based Desktop Environment and the underlaying framework in order to provide users and developers with easy to use but yet powerful software. The project's aim is to develop modern and sleek libraries, services and applications to improve the desktop experience for new and advanced users.

<h2>Compose your Desktop</h2>

Cream's most essential philosophy is that every user - being a complete »newbie« or an advanced one - should be encouraged and enabled to compile his own »made to measure« Desktop Shell.

<h3>Revamp GNOME</h3>

<h2>Extend your Desktop</h2>

<h1>Modules - Foundations of you Desktop Shell</h1>

<h2>Melange</h2>
