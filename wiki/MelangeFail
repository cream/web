Getting Melange to FAIL
=======================

How to Reproduce
----------------

1. Start Melange.
2. Add one of the following widgets with Melange-Control:
    - Example Widget
    - Paste Widget
3. Play around with the widget.
4. Remove the widget while using it (e. g. uploading a paste).

With a bit of luck Melange will die.

Suggestions
-----------

- The JSContext gets destroyed and freed before the last actions has completed (threads!).

Possible Solutions?
-------------------

- Check context before using it. If it is not available raise a Python exception.
- Don't destroy the context. (Oh, really?)
