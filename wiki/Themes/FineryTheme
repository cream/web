Cream Finery Theme
==================

The Cream Finery Theme is a Metacity- and GTK+ Theme based on Ubuntu's new Radiance theme, but with a lot of improvements and enhancements.

Ideas
-----
 * Perhaps less gloss on buttons
 * More emboss on progressbar background
 * Simple, flat list items
 * Top margin of Notebook-Tabs should be more than 0px
 * Menubar color == window background color, while toolbar's getting a gradient
 * Fix the weird shade switching (light/dark, dark/light) when hovering over a ComboBox
