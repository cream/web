Getting started with Cream
==========================

After `installing Cream from git`_, you can begin to use the different parts of Cream.

Melange
-------

Starting Melange
++++++++++++++++

To start Melange, just *cd* into the ``src/modules/melange`` directory and run ``melange.py``.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd <YOUR_CREAM_FOLDER>/src/modules/melange/src
  $ python melange.py

You can move around your widgets using a *middle click*. If you *right click* on a widget this will open a context menu with three different actions:

- **Configure**: Opens the configuration dialog
- **Reload**: Reloads the widget.
- **Remove**: Removes the widget from your desktop.
- **About**: Opens an about dialog with some information about the widget and its author(s).
