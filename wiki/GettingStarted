Getting started with Cream
==========================

After `installing Cream from git`_, you can begin to use the different parts of Cream.

Melange
-------

Starting Melange
++++++++++++++++

To start Melange, just *cd* into the ``src/modules/melange`` directory and run ``melange.py``.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd <YOUR_CREAM_FOLDER>/src/modules/melange
  $ python melange.py

Adding widgets
++++++++++++++

Now, let's add some widgets. To do so, you have to start *Melange Control* which is in the ``src/modules/melange-control`` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd <YOUR_CREAM_FOLDER>/src/modules/melange-control
  $ python melange-control.py

This will open a window listing all the widgets currently available. Just choose one of them and press the *Add*-button
to add it to your desktop.

Handling widgets
++++++++++++++++

You can move around your widgets using a *middle click*. If you *right click* on a widget this will open a context menu with three different actions:

- **Reload**: Reloads the widget.
- **Remove**: Removes the widget from your desktop.
- **About**: Opens an about dialog with some information about the widget and its author(s).

Overlay
+++++++

On the top right corner is a little *thingy* which is similar to the cashew of the Plasma desktop. If you click on it,
an overlay is being placed above your opened windows and all widgets will appear on this overlay.

If you *right click* on it, there is an option *Preferences* where you can change the hotkey for displaying the overlay (default: ``F12``).
It is also possible to create different profiles you can choose from.
