Getting started with Cream
==========================

After `installing Cream from git`_, you can begin to use the different parts of Cream.

Melange
-------

Starting Melange
++++++++++++++++

To start Melange, just *cd* into the ``src/modules/melange`` directory and run ``melange.py``. $YOUR_CREAM_FOLDER is the folder you have cream living in.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd $YOUR_CREAM_FOLDER/src/modules/melange
  $ python melange.py

Adding widgets
++++++++++++++

Now, let's add some widgets. To do so, you have to start *Melange Control* which is in the ``src/modules/melange-control`` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd $YOUR_CREAM_FOLDER/src/modules/melange-control
  $ python melange-control.py
