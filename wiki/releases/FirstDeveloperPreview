First developer preview of Cream
================================

On March, -23- 24 2010 we released our first experimental developer preview of Cream for anyone who is interested, so that you can get an insight of how great Cream's potential is.

There are two ways to install it:

1. Follow the instructions in `Install from Git`_
2. Use our Cream install script for Ubuntu as described in the following paragraph

In case of Ubuntu you'll need 9.10 (karmic) or higher.

Cream Ubuntu Installer
----------------------

Just go through the following steps:

1. Download the package here: `Ubuntu Installer`_
2. Navigate into the folder ``prealpha-1``
3. Double-click on ``setup-ubuntu``
4. Choose the button *Run*
5. Wait until the installation has finished. Then click *OK*

Now Cream is installed. To start the widget system *Melange*, double-click on ``melange`` and choose the button *Run*. To add widgets you need to start *Melange Control* by double-clicking on ``melange-control`` and - again  - choosing the *Run* button.

For further instructions how to use *Melange* take a look at our `Getting started`_ page.
