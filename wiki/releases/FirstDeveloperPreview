First Developer Preview
=======================

This is our first experimental developer preview. We provide you with this simplier way of testing Cream that you can help us by giving feedback.

There are two ways to install this Developer Preview:

1. `Install Cream from Git`_
2. Follow the instructions below (Ubuntu 9.10 or higher!)

Cream Ubuntu Installer
----------------------

Just go through the following steps:

1. Download the package: `Ubuntu Installer`_
2. Change your working directory to ``prealpha-1``
3. Run ``setup-ubuntu`` in oder to setup the snapshot.
4. Wait until the installation has finished. Then click *OK*.

You can use our widget system Melange by running the scripts ``melange`` and ``melange-control`` (in that order).

Please refer to the `Getting started`_ page for more information.
